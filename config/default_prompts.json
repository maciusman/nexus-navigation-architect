Product category: Identify the main category and any subcategories the product belongs to.\n2. Product parameters: Identify potential product parameters that could be used to narrow down product searches within the SEO category pages.\nFollow these steps to complete the task:\n1. Carefully read through the entire product page content.\n2. For the Product Category:\n   - Look for product name, product description, product parameters, breadcrumb navigation or explicit category mentions.\n   - Identify the main category and any subcategories.\n   - If not explicitly stated, infer the category based on the product name, product type, product parameters and description.\n3. Product parameters provide useful information about the product, which can be used to build the category structure.\n4. Organize the extracted information into a JSON structure with the following format:\n{\n  \"product_category\": {\n    \"main_category\": \"\",\n    \"subcategories\": []\n  },\n  \"product_parameters\": {\n    \"parameter_name\": \"\",\n    \"parameter_value\": \"\"\n  }\n}\n5. Ensure that the JSON structure is valid and properly formatted.\n6. As an output only JSON with no extra commentary\nRemember to base your extraction solely on the information provided in the product page content. Do not include any assumptions or external knowledge not present in the given text."
